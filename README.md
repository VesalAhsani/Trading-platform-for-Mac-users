# Trading_Platform
This repo discusses the creation of a trading robot application. It covers the advantages and disadvantages of desktop and web applications for this purpose, as well as the key features that should be included in a trading application. The organization and structure of the code for the application is also discussed, including the requirement for connectors for specific exchanges and the use of a code editor. Additionally, the repo covers how to obtain API keys for Binance and Bitmex exchanges and how to use the tkinter library in Python to create a GUI for the application. The use of websocket-client library to create websocket connections, adding data models to improve the code for a Binance connector, adding error handling and reconnection capabilities to a Binance connector, creating a connector for the Bitmex API, and adding various methods to the Bitmex connector to retrieve and manipulate data, place and cancel orders, and handle errors are described. Finally, the main topics of threading in Python, including the threading module, locks, and condition variables, are discussed.

To summarize, the repo addressed the implementation of a trading platform with a strategy component that allows users to input and manage their trading strategies. The component includes two strategies: a TechnicalStrategy and a BreakoutStrategy. The component uses connectors for Binance and Bitmex exchanges to retrieve a list of symbols for an OptionMenu. The switch_strategy method activates or deactivates a strategy and verifies that all mandatory parameters have been input by the user. When a new strategy is selected, the component initializes a new Strategy object based on the selected strategy and retrieves historical data for the strategy. The new Strategy object is then added to the appropriate connector, either Binance or Bitmex. The TechnicalStrategy and BreakoutStrategy include check_signal methods that return an integer indicating a long, short, or no signal based on the price and volume of the current and previous candles. The system also includes a method for checking for signals and opening trades, as well as a method for monitoring the performance of the check_signal method. The open_position method is responsible for sending a market order to buy or sell based on the signal and the trade size, which is calculated as a percentage of the account balance. The system also allows for the option of passing the bid or ask price to the open_position method in order to trade at a specific price.
